# Pattern-Generator

An app for generating colorful repeating pattern images:

### How to use

Shape buttons allow you to select which svg file is used for the pattern.

Color sliders set the color via HSL values.

Parameter sliders change the attributes of the pattern (gap between shapes, canvas size, etc).

The `Randomize` button sets the seed to a different value while maintaining the set parameters.

Randomising the seed will give a different pattern but with a very similar appearance.

To save the pattern right click on the pattern and click `Save Image As`.
